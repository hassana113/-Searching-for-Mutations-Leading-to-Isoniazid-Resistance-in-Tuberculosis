# -Searching-for-Mutations-Leading-to-Isoniazid-Resistance-in-Tuberculosis

## Project overview

Tuberculosis (TB) remains a global health concern, and the emergence of drug-resistant strains poses a significant challenge to effective treatment. Isoniazid is a key first-line drug used in the treatment of TB, and resistance to this drug can compromise the success of therapy.
This project aims to identify and characterise genetic mutations associated with isoniazid resistance in _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_, the causative agent of Tuberculosis.
